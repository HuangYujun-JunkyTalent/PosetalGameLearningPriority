    Iterate over all distinct partial orders (reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive relations)

    Strategy:
    - Enumerate all directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) on the vertex set (edges taken from all ordered pairs without loops).
    - For each DAG, compute its transitive closure; this closure uniquely determines a partial order.
    - Deduplicate closures (different DAGs can represent the same partial order).
    Complexity: For n elements we examine up to 2^{n(n-1)} edge subsets, but practical up to n<=5.
